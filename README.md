### Simulations of star formation

#### Hydrodynamic simulations with an initial population of stars 
Simulations of star formation on molecular cloud scales typically start with a turbu-
lent region of gas, or for example the collision of two clouds. In reality, a typical region
within a galaxy may already include, or reside near some population of stars contain-
ing massive stars undergoing feedback. As such, generations of stars may influence the
formation of subsequent generations, particularly through feedback. We present sim-
ulations of sub galactic regions, in which we pre-populate our models with an evolved
system of stars, based on a prior galaxy scale simulation. We investigate including initial
ionising stars, initial HII regions and stars which will imminently undergo supernovae.
Surprisingly, So far we find that having an initial stellar population does not strongly
effect the evolution when comparing to simulations without pre-existing stars. We also
investigate the reliability of extracting regions in simulations, and show that with a good
choice of region, results are comparable with using a larger region for the duration of
our simulations.
#### Magnetohydrodynamic simulations with an initial population of stars 
Simulations of star formation on molecular cloud scales typically start with a turbulent region of gas, or for example the collision of two clouds. Realistically, a typical region within a galaxy may already include, or reside near some population of stars containing massive stars undergoing feedback. In this work we investigate the interactions of Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) on kpc scales, focussing on how feedback from massive stars impact star formation throughout the region. Our sub galactic region includes ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), photo-ionising and supernova feedback. So far we find that ionising and supernova feedback trigger star formation, through the expansion of hot ionised bubbles, whilst MHD suppresses star formation, smoothing out small over densities within inter-arm regions and prolonging GMC collapse across the spiral arm. Cosmic rays are expected to play an important role in the star formation process and will be sourced when supernovae occur. We aim to include a feedback prescription for modelling the impact and propagation of cosmic rays throughout the sub galactic region.
